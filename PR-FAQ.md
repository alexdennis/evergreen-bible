# The Evergreen Bible PR / FAQ

Announcing the Evergreen Bible, a Bible API that can be freely consumed by any application, with a mainline and beta variant, where the language updates to match common usage patterns over time. 

It requires locale as an input parameter, and so is not limited to English.

It is powered by a knowledge graph representation of the Bible that is symbolic.

Our language experts, codify translations that use language models and statical analysis of common usage patterns in a specific locale to produce the final results.  This means that the language stays relevant and fresh and new versions automatically get released regularly.


A core feature is the option to return synthesized speech as well as text. Another feature is a search API that takes text, sound or even images as input.

Launching along side the API, is the Evergreen Bible art generator which comes with a visual search. Point your camera at a babbling brook or a mountain, and the search  finds matching verses that you  can use as overlay before you share to social media. 

Also launching is The Rock, a conversational app, available on Google Assistant and Alexa that provides a fluent interface for interacting with the Bible. 

# FAQ

## What is the beta variant?

The beta variant allows early adopters to provide distributed feedback, but the aim is a single translation on the release branch.

## Why is locale an input instead of language?

Our vision is one Bible that spans the globe. The translation is contextualized per region based on local language usage patterns.

## How do you maintain quality?

We care a lot about quality. Our translation will run through automated as well as manual quality checks before being released to the public.

## What is a symbolic knowledge graph?

We have taken the essence of the Bible, it's structure and have developed a novel representation that allows automated translation into any language when combined with the model of the target language. We are applying the state of the art in machine learning to this problem space.

## Can I call this API from my application?

Yes, you can! We have a free tier that enables any body to develop their own application on top of this API.
